# GPS capability description file
#
# Our apologies to all Unix hackers in advance for the grubby .INI syntax,
# we're using it because the format has good cross-Unix support in Python.
#
# Each section map have the following capabilities
#
# type	       = "engine", "vendor", or "device"
# description  = Human-readable description of this item
# packaging    = A device's form factor
# reference    = URL to technical documentation, or at least a spec sheet
# vendor_site  = URL of a vendor site
# vendor       = vendor name
# eval_unit    = Which GPSD devs have one for testing (list)
# engine       = GPS chipset (may reference another section)
# subtype      = engine subtype or firmware revision level
# interfaces   = interface types: USB, RS232, Bluetooth, CF, TTL. May be a list.
# usbchip      = USB I/O chipset
# pps	       = supports pulse-per-second precision time reporting
# noconfigure  = can be bricked by baud-rate changes (requires -b option)
# tested       = last gpsd tested, or "regression" if we have a test load
# nmea	       = NMEA version this emits, if known
# notes	       = Miscellaneous notes on this item.  To be interpreted as HTML.
# status       = excellent, good, fair, poor, broken, other
# discontinued = If present, product has been discontinued
#
# Capability strings:
#
# to_nmea     = if present, how to switch to NMEA 0183 mode from native binary
# to_native   = if present, how to swith to native binary mode from NMEA
# modeset     = set protocol, baud rate, 8N1
#
# Inheritance
#
# To inherit capabilities from a specified section, name the section in
# a "uses =" attribute. Use chains are followed recursively.  An attribute
# in a section overrides all attributes of the same name in all ancestor
# sections.
#
# Certain escapes in capability strings are translated:
#
# %b	- baud rate as ASCII numeral
#
# A string beginning with 0x is interpreted as a sequence of paired hex bytes,
# leading 0x not included.
#
# Comment lines led with "#%" are vendor section marks to be used when
# generating an HTML table from this file.  Each should consist of a vendor
# name.
#
# Further notes:
# * In the packaging feld, a "GPS mouse" is a standalone sensor in a
#   display-less case designed be used as an outbard peripheral.  An
#   "OEM module" is an un-cased circuit board with edge connectors; a
#   "chipset" is what it sounds like.
#   A "handset" is a standalone GPS with a display and human-usable
#   controls. A "handsfree" is a hands-free unit with display designed for 
#   mounting on a car windshield or boat dash.
# * In the status field:
#    "excellent" - gpsd recognizes the GPS rapidly and reliably,
#		  reports are complete and correct.
#    "good" -- gpsd has minor problems or lag recognizing the device,
#	      but reports are complete and correct.
#    "fair" -- Reports have minor dropouts or problems, including occasional
#	      transient nonsense values.
#    "poor" -- Reports frequently have values that are wrong or nonsense.
#    "broken" -- gpsd frequently fails to recognize the device at all.
#    "other -- See Technical Notes.
