19970421 released version 0.7 ...
19970425 version 0.8, some bug fixes. New MODE member, STATUS member changed.
19970513 some cleanups in the ini code. version 0.9 ...
19980127 combined gpsd + gpsclient. No more init files, command line only.
19980127 using GNU autoconf now. version 0.93 ...
19990124 Y2K compliant ;-)  (... is NOT. Look for "FIXME:" in nmea_parse.c)
19990206 (0.95)
	 Added suport for EarthMate receivers. Since I do not
	 have one, this is untested.
	 If it works, it does the following:
	  You start gpsd with a baudrate of 9600 and give
	  it the -Te option. If gpsd gets the EartMate id it
	  will enable the receiver and then attempt to switch
	  it into NMEA mode.
	  If the EarthMate id is not received, but a binary
	  data header is received, then we will try to switch
	  NMEA too.
19990304 (0.96)
	 Changed EarthMate support. Rockwell binary is now almost properly
	 supported. Only the minimum required information is extracted.
19990717 (0.99)
	 Rockwell binary is now translated to NMEA format, so that
	 clients like gps will work with an EarthMate.
	 Added speedometer application. Thanks to Derrick J Brashear
	 for his work (see README for contact info).
19991213 (0.99-dgps)
	 Added minimal DGPS support by Derrick J Brashear
20000102 (1.0)
	 Added DGPS fixes from Curt Mills. (See README for contact info.)
20000305 (1.01)
	 Updated to IANA port.
	 Fixes to DGPS support.
20000317 (1.02) (even though version.h says 1.01)
20000512 (1.05) (even though version.h says 1.04)
	 Added some includes to xgpsspeed.c for portability.
	 Fix problem with flags being overwritten, and using the wrong port
	 variable also in xgpsspeed.c
	 Add a note about Y2K compatibility fix.
	 Pass latitude and longitude into em_init().
20000711 (1.06)
	 Change from C++ (/) to C comments (/* */)for compatibility.
	 Added -n (need init) flag.
	 Don't init unless lat/lon specified.
	 Remove gps.mayko.com as the default hostname.
20020926 (1.07)
	 Remco: What happened to 1.03?
	  em.c uses <time.h> (as it should). Removed some <sys/time.h>
	  where they were not needed.
	 Russ Nelson: Improved Earthmate support: added state machine for
	  EARTHA recognizer, removed alignment problems seen on ARM
	  architecture.  Added setsockopt to add SO_REUSEADDR, so that
	  gpsd can stop and immediately restart.  Added support for bitrates
	  higher than 38400, needed for the SIRF chipset.
	 Derrick: my patch causes longitude when under 100 degrees to be printed 
	  zero-padded as needed, the latitude same deal under 10, fixes the GGA
	  sentence to not erroneously print fix type (2/3) instead of fix quality,
	  and calculates fix type correctly.
