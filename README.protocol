This is a translation of the protocol spec used between gpsd and
its clients. The spec was originally written in "C", but for popular
demand translated to english. Keep in mind that this is not the
original document, if in doubt, read the source...

1. The gpsd protocol is very simple. The idea was to have gpsd do all
   the nasty nmea parsing (or whatever original format) and translate
   the information into bits a program can easily digest.

2. Gpsd listens for clients. When a client connects, gpsd waits for
   the client to send requests. Gpsd requests are single letters.
   A request gets executed when gpsd sees a '\n' (0x0a) from the
   client.

3. The following requests are implemented:

	p  Returns the current position in the form "P=%f %f".
	d  Returns the date in the form "D=%s".
	a  The current altitude as "A=%f".
	v  The current speed (velocity) as "V=%f".
	t  The track (direction of movement) as "T=%d".
	s  The gps status as "S=%d".
	m  The gps mode as "M=%d".
	r  Toggles 'raw' mode. Return "R=0" or "R=1"
	g  Returns six-digit Maidenhead grid square (like FN12fx)

   If a client wants information that is contained in the gps data,
   but there is no gpsd request for it, kindly add the request.
   Requesting raw mode, and parsing nmea yourself is not a good
   solution.

4. Requests can be concatenated and sent as a string. Gpsd will then
   reply with a comma seperated list of replies.

5. Every gpsd reply will start with the string "GPSD" followed by
   the replies.

   Examples:
      query:       "p\n"
      reply:       "GPSD,P=36.000000 123.000000\r\n"

      query:       "d\n"
      reply:       "GPSD,D=11/16/2002 02:45:05\r\n"

      query:       "va\n"
      reply:       "GPSD,V=0.000000,A=37.900000\r\n"

6. Use telnet to connect to a gpsd.
   "telnet localhost 2947"

   Type p and hit enter. You should get a reply like
   in the above example.

7. Queries are case insensitive. "P" or "p" will do the same thing.
   The first occurence of either '\r' or '\n' will execute the query.
   So "va\n", "vA\r", and "VA\r\n" are equivalent.
