This is a list of developer tools included in the SVN source tarball
but not necessarily shipped in the tarball or binary distributions If you're
viewing it with Emacs, you can try doing Ctl-C Ctl-t browse through
the outline headers.  Ctl-C Ctl-a will unfold them again.

** findbreakage

Starting from a specified SVN revision number, this Python program runs 
regression tests forward until something fails.  It uses a binary search, so
convergence should be very rapid.

** hackcomment

Alters the change comment attached to a specified SVN revision.

** leapsecond.py

Gets the current leap-second correction forom IERS and/or the USNO.

** logextract

Extract pure NMEA from an emailed gpsd error log. The output can be fed 
to gpsfake. (This one goes in the tarball.)

** regress-driver

Runs or rebuilds the regression-test set.

** regress-builder

This script runs an exhaustive test on combinations of compilation options, 
looking for ones 

** striplog

Strip leading comment lines from NMEA sentence logs.  gpsfake can do
this itself now, so this script has a lot of dust on it.  (This one
goes in the tarball.)

** www/upload

Refresh the project website.  Doesn't require shipper.
