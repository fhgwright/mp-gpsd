19970421 released version 0.7 ...
19970425 version 0.8, some bug fixes. New MODE member, STATUS member changed.
19970513 some cleanups in the ini code. version 0.9 ...
19980127 combined gpsd + gpsclient. No more init files, command line only.
19980127 using GNU autoconf now. version 0.93 ...
19990124 Y2K compliant ;-)  (... is NOT. Look for "FIXME:" in nmea_parse.c)
19990206 (0.95)
	 Added suport for EarthMate receivers. Since I do not
	 have one, this is untested.
	 If it works, it does the following:
	  You start gpsd with a baudrate of 9600 and give
	  it the -Te option. If gpsd gets the EartMate id it
	  will enable the receiver and then attempt to switch
	  it into NMEA mode.
	  If the EarthMate id is not received, but a binary
	  data header is received, then we will try to switch
	  NMEA too.
19990304 (0.96)
	 Changed EarthMate support. Rockwell binary is now almost properly
	 supported. Only the minimum required information is extracted.
19990717 (0.99)
	 Rockwell binary is now translated to NMEA format, so that
	 clients like gps will work with an EarthMate.
	 Added speedometer application. Thanks to Derrick J Brashear
	 for his work (see README for contact info).
19991213 (0.99-dgps)
	 Added minimal DGPS support by Derrick J Brashear
20000102 (1.0)
	 Added DGPS fixes from Curt Mills. (See README for contact info.)
20000305 (1.01)
	 Updated to IANA port.
	 Fixes to DGPS support.
20020205 (1.07)
	 What happend with 1.02 to 1.06?
	 em.c uses <time.h> (as it should). Removed some <sys/time.h>
	 where they were not needed.
20021003 (1.08)
	 Added sockopt SO_REUSEADDR to netlib.c passive_sock.
20021103 
	 G or g command returns six-digit Maidenhead grid square (like FN12fx)
20030216 (1.09)
	 Include sys/time.h in gpsd.c for struct timeval.
20030818 
	 Use cfset[io]speed() to set speed in serial.h. Glibc is quite insane
	 and I am tired to chase it, so I give up. Hope this works for BSD.
	 Set status and mode 0 after GPS timeout (5 sec) - Cougar <cougar@random.ee>
20030820 (1.10)
	 Add install target. Fix clean target. Make GPS timeout configurable.
	 Make xgpsspeed build with Apple's X11.
	 Make sure that we don't segfault if the NMEA is badly formed.
20031220
	 Removed <varargs.h> from netlib. Not needed, and new gcc does not support
	 it any more.
