This is a list of developer tools included in the source repository
but not necessarily shipped in the tarball or binary distributions If you're
viewing it with Emacs, you can try doing Ctl-C Ctl-t browse through
the outline headers.  Ctl-C Ctl-a will unfold them again.

== ais.py ==

AIS packet decoder in Python.  Useful as a check on the C code.

== aidvmtable ==

Generate an asciidoc table of the six-bit encoding used in AIVDM packets.

== cycle_analyzer ==

Finds end-of-cycle sentences from GPS output logs.

== editcomment ==

Give this a commit-ID specification.  It will edit the associated comment.
Usual caveats apply; the edited one and all commits after will change IDs,
and pushing them to a repo with the old commits will wreak havoc.
Note also that this cavalierly overwrites refs/original.

== fakeserver ==

Analogue of gpsfake. Impersonates a gpsd, spewing specified data to
clients connecting to localhost:2947

== fakecompare ==

Compare the results from running gpsfake on a logfile between this
machine and a remote one.  Especially useful when remote and local
have different word lengths.

== flock* ==

The files prefixed with flock are the scripts, data files, and 
documentation for the flock-test suite. Read flock-instructions for 
explanation.

== leapsecond.py ==

Gets the current leap-second correction forom IERS and/or the USNO.

== logextract ==

Extract pure NMEA from an emailed gpsd error log. The output can be fed 
to gpsfake.

== regress-builder ==

This script runs an exhaustive test on combinations of compilation options, 
looking for ones that break the build.

== regressdiff ==

Walk through a pair of text files looking for where they begin to differ.
May be useful for comparing logs when regression tests break.

== striplog ==

Strip leading comment lines from NMEA sentence logs.  gpsfake can do
this itself now, so this script has a lot of dust on it.
